Lots of folks have r[ead our paper showing that using AI boosted the quality
of the work done by consultants at the top-tier Boston Consulting Company by
40%](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged), but
there is a key factor in that paper that most people are missing. The
consultants were not given some special version of AI, trained on proprietary
data and with a customized interface. Nope, they were just given GPT-4 with
minimal training and examples. The plain old GPT-4 from back in April, before
all of its new capabilities were added. The same GPT-4 that everyone in 169
countries can access for free, via Microsoft Bing in creative mode. And while
some of the consultants received a small amount of training (which didn’t help
much), most of them just started using the AI without any instructions.

And they still saw massive performance increases.

The lesson is that just using AI will teach you how to use AI. You can become
a world expert in the application of AI to your domain by just using AI a lot
until you figure out what it is good and bad at. This is one of two reasons
that I dislike the emphasis on prompting that pervades much of the discussions
of AI: it makes using AI systems seem much harder and more mysterious than it
is. Just use it and see where that takes you.

The second reason I don’t like the emphasis on prompting is that, for most
people, having to worry about prompts at all is a very temporary state of
affairs. As AI systems improve, the need for esoteric prompting decreases,
because the AIs themselves become good at figuring out what you might want. My
favorite illustration of this change is in AI image creators. If you didn’t
already know, OpenAI released a new image creator called DALL-E3 (you can get
it through paid ChatGPT Plus by selecting the DALL-E mode, or free through
Bing). While it is not significantly better than other image makers (like
Midjourney or Adobe Firefly), there is an important difference: rather than
creating prompts for images, the DALL-E system lets you just talk to the AI
about the art you want, and the AI creates the prompts for you.

For example, I can just ask the AI to: _Create a cool scene that looks like a
still from a movie of a car chase with two muscle cars. Hyper realistic,
please._

[![A hyperrealistic photo capturing an intense moment in a desert setting
where two muscle cars are engaged in a car chase. The scene shows a bright
blue Dodge Charger, with its V8 engine thunderously roaring, kicking up a
cloud of dust as it races across a barren, sunbaked desert. Chasing it is a
fiery orange Pontiac GTO, its driver determined and skilled, maneuvering
expertly through the rough terrain. The background features towering red
sandstone formations under a clear blue sky, adding a sense of wild, rugged
adventure to the

The prompt the AI wrote: A hyperrealistic photo capturing an intense moment in
a desert setting where two muscle cars are engaged in a car chase. The scene
shows a bright blue Dodge Charger, with its V8 engine thunderously roaring,
kicking up a cloud of dust as it races across a barren, sunbaked desert.
Chasing it is a fiery orange Pontiac GTO, its driver determined and skilled,
maneuvering expertly through the rough terrain. The background features
towering red sandstone formations under a clear blue sky, adding a sense of
wild, rugged adventure to the chase.

You can see the long, evocative prompt the AI wrote under the image. The
results are okay, but not exactly what I want: _I wanted it to be much more
hyper realistic though. This seems like a painting, not a scene from a movie._

The caption the AI wrote: An ultra-hyperrealistic photo of a thrilling car

Very close now. _Cool, the scene is pretty good. Can you keep the same scene

Done. (Everything you see was the first attempt from the AI, no editing. It
only took a minute.)

But what if I want to do it the old-fashioned (two weeks ago is old-fashioned
in AI) way? To do that requires prompt-crafting using a tool like MidJourney.
I started with a prompt for movie scenes I had learned from a [random Twitter
account](https://x.com/bubblez_jazzy/status/1698255033991565655?s=20) (and
which I would never have thought of myself), containing a collection of
keywords: Ultra Panavision 70, warm-toned Eastman Kodak film, raw style. Then
I kept generating images, playing with the details, modifying the prompt. I
was never able to get exactly the image I wanted, but, on the other hand, it
looks more like an actual shot from a movie, if not quite the movie I wanted.
It took ten minutes, but only because I was very familiar with Midjourney. A
novice would spend a lot more time.

21:9 --c 10

This, I think, illustrates the current state of prompting quite well. On one
hand, as you saw with DALL-E3, I don’t need any specialized skills to make an
image. I just ask the AI what I want, and it does it. We can call this the
_conversational_ approach to prompting. While right now the image is only 80%
as good as the one from Midjourney, it will, over time, get much better. I
don’t need to learn any special skills, I just have to wait and let technology
advance.

On the other hand, I can get better results with prompt-crafting, at least for
now. This requires me to spend a lot of time and effort learning to use
Midjourney and creating the perfect prompt. It looks a bit better, I have more
direct control, and the results may be more unique. But I need to learn the
formula for these sorts of prompts. However, once I have a prompt that works
well, I can also pass it to others, who can get similar results. We call these
_Structured Prompts._ They are like AI programs that let other people benefit
from what you learned and explored.

For most people, today, a conversational approach is enough to help them with
their work. For some uses, at least for now, more formal structured prompts
have value. No matter which approach you use, you should experiment with the
most advanced model you can get your hands on. Right now, that is GPT-4
(please, please don’t use the free ChatGPT, which uses GPT-3.5, it is far less
powerful) or Claude 2, but a new Google model is expected soon.

## Conversational Prompting

For most people, you can just talk to the AI to ask for what you want. You can
even talk to the AI if you don’t know what you want - just tell it what you
might need and see what happens.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-

media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F29c12bfd-900b-4055-9678-16f1acf7c3dc_1779x1266.png)

As a chatbot, the AI is really built for exactly this sort of use, where you
speak with the AI as if it’s another person: the infinitely helpful graduate
student who is a little naive and wants to make you so happy that they will
make up facts rather than disappoint you. As you work with the AI using this
approach, you’ll develop an intuition for what its limits and strengths are,
where it is generally truthful, and when it is unreliable.

There is one major trick that will make your conversations work better:
**provide context**. You can (inaccurately but usefully) imagine the AIs
knowledge as huge cloud. In one corner of that cloud the AI answers only in
Shakespearean sonnets, in another it answers as a mortgage broker, in a third
it draws mostly on mathematical formulas from high school textbooks. By
default, the AI gives you answers from the center of the cloud, the most
likely answers to the question for the average person. You can, by providing
context, push the AI to a more interesting corner of its knowledge, resulting
in you getting more unique answers that might better fit your questions. Many
of the more exciting uses of AI require this sort of specialization.

The simplest way to do this is to start with giving the AI an identity ( _you
are an expert, friendly teacher who helps students with complex topics_ **).**
While that does not magically turn it into an accurate teacher, it helps give
the AI the context of what types of answers you need, and what tone to use.
You can also provide context in other ways, such as by pasting in the text you
are working on, or a form you need to fill out, and seeing how it answers.

[![Wide illustration showing a diffuse, intricate web of ideas representing
AI's knowledge space. The web is vast and detailed, with areas more densely
woven for common knowledge and thinner, more intricate sections for
specialized areas like 'Shakespearean Sonnets', 'Mortgage Advice',
'Mathematics'. In the center, the web is most tightly knit, labeled as
'General Knowledge'. Around the edges, users provide context, represented as
beams of light or directional arrows, guiding the AI towards these unique,
finer strands of the web, demonstrating the shift from general to specific,

asked ChatGPT to illustrate the previous paragraphs.

For most people, this is good enough to get started, and it is the technique I
use most of the time when working with AI. Don’t overcomplicate things, just
interact with the system and see what happens. After you have some experience,
however, you may decide that you want to create prompts you can share with
others, prompts that incorporate your expertise. We call this approach
_Structured Prompting_ , and, while improving AIs may make it irrelevant soon,
it is currently a useful tool for helping others by encoding your knowledge
into a prompt that anyone can use.

## Structured Prompting

Structured Prompting is about turning the AI into a tool that does a single
task well in a way that is repeatable and adapts to its user. Since the AI is
not always built to do this, it will take experimentation and effort to make a
prompt work somewhat consistently (it is very hard to reach 100% consistency
with LLMs). To start, you need a clear goal. For example, in this prompt from[
our paper on AI and
teaching](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4475995), we
want the AI to run a pre-mortem, an exercise where you image how a project
might fail in order to decrease the risk of real failure. There are specific
ways to do a pre-mortem, and, with the current generation of AI, there is
value in ensuring that it is doing the process correctly, rather than just
responding to chat requests. That is where the Structured Prompt comes in. You
can see an example below (or experiment with it
[here](https://chat.openai.com/share/7d3c89ca-283e-4706-a116-693e85a25558))

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc011d800-77dc-4374-a26a-852f39eca440_1242x725.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-
post-
media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc011d800-77dc-4374-a26a-852f39eca440_1242x725.png)

The prompt is made of multiple elements:

 **Role and Goal.** Just as we did in conversational approaches, role and
goal-based constraints limit the AI to a narrower, more appropriate range of
responses, and the role taps into the AI's natural language understanding
capabilities, leveraging its pre-trained knowledge of effective conversation
within that persona.

**Step-by-step instructions.** Giving the AI instructions is key to getting
the useful output. A good rule of thumb is: if instructions are easy for
someone else to understand (who is unfamiliar with your specific request or
domain) then the AI is more likely to understand your instructions.
Additionally, the better organized those instructions are the more likely it
is that you’ll get useful output. Because the AI is more familiar with some
topics than with others, don’t assume knowledge of any specific topic. When
you give the AI instructions you should be concise, and use simple and direct
language, avoiding ambiguous words. You can begin with a goal or an overview
(explain the purpose of the task or question and the outcome you are looking
for), which sometimes seems to help orient the LLM.

Research has found that it often works best to give the AI explicit
instructions that go step-by-step through what you want. One approach, called
[Chain of Thought prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), gives the AI
an example of how you want it to reason before you make your request, but you
can also give it step-by-step directions the way we do in this prompt. If your
instructions have multiple parts clearly highlight those parts ( _First come
up with several strategies I should consider when writing a business plan_.
_Then, explain each of those strategies and given my business, how I can
develop those.)_   If you’d like help with a complex or multi step problem
break the problem down into steps and ask the AI to “think step by step.” As
with any AI interaction (and especially one that is complex) check and
evaluate steps along the way. Is the AI progressing as expected? Is it
following and keeping track of your instructions? If it isn’t, you can adjust
your approach.

 **Expertise (“Pedagogy” in the above case).** The most important part of a
structured prompt is your own knowledge and viewpoint on the right way for the
AI to act in the prompt. Here, you can see that we had a pedagogical vision
about how the AI should work with students to push them to consider failure
points, not by providing answers, but by asking the students questions. You
should figure out what you want the AI to do, and how it differs from its
default behavior.

 **Constraints:** Constraints within a prompt are rules or conditions that
guide the behavior of the AI in its interactions with the user. For instance,
when asked to play the role of a Tutor, the AI will often play out both the
role of tutor and that of student. If the goal of the prompt is to help a
student learn a concept then constraining the AI “Wait for the student to
respond before moving on” helps guide the AI in its interactions with the
user. Constraints may also make the behavior of the AI more predictable. For
instance, if the AI is given a series of questions to ask the user and told to
“only ask one question at a time” that constraint allows a more interactive
and guided conversation. Additional constraints might limit the length of the
AI’s responses so that these aren’t overwhelming, or limit the number of back
and forth exchanges so that the AI doesn’t get stuck in a loop or lose track
of the conversation. You can also define when and how the AI initiates
conversations. For instance, “always wait for the user to begin the
conversation” or “always begin the conversation by introducing yourself as the
AI-Coach here to help the team conduct an after action review.”

 **Personalization**. Prompts that solicit information from users can be
particularly useful. You can ask the AI to ask questions to work out a
problem. Since the AI only “knows” the context it is given, working with it
through a series of questions gives the AI context it can use to help you. In
a Structured Prompt, putting the AI in the role of guide who asks you
questions is part of the design of a general purpose prompt – it helps
personalize the interaction so that the AI can adapt to different scenarios.

A few other things that might help:

 **Examples and Few-shot.  **Few-shot learning involves giving the model a
small number of examples (or "shots") to guide its behavior on a new task.
This is in contrast to zero shot learning which gives the model no examples
but asks it to reason on its own. In few-shot prompting, the model is given a
couple of examples of the kind of content, writing, or decisions you want the
AI to output. The abstract instructions paired with examples enhances the AI’s
ability to adapt and respond. We don’t do that in this prompt, but you can
experiment with providing examples in your own prompts.

 **Asking for specific output.** Finally, given the models’ capabilities,
there are many outputs that you can request. For instance, you can ask for an
image, an explanation, a chart, a table, a document, an excel spreadsheet, or
a website. Experiment with different approaches, you might be surprised.

 _Added as of 11/2:_ **Appeals to emotion.** I am not 100% sure of how to feel
about this myself,[ but a recent paper suggests that
LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11760.pdf), including ChatGPT-3.5 and GPT-4,
produce results that are almost 10% higher in quality on a variety of
dimensions when you add an emotional appeal. In the paper, they simply added
one of several emotional phrases to the end of their request, including “This
is very important to my career,” “You'd better be sure,” “Take pride in your
work and give it your best. Your commitment to excellence sets you apart,” and
“Are you sure that's your final answer? Believe in your abilities and strive
for excellence. Your hard work will yield remarkable results.” Different
phrases were useful in different contexts, so there is no one best phrase,
though the career one often worked well. So, as uncomfortable as giving this
advice is, you may just want to throw something like this at the end of your
prompt. The research has no answer yet about why it works. AI is weird
sometimes.

As a final step, you need to check your prompt by trying it out, giving it
good, bad, and neutral input. Take the perspective of your users– is the AI
helpful? Does the process work? How might the AI be more helpful? Does it need
more context? Does it need further constraints? You can continue to tweak the
prompt until it works for you and until you feel it will work for your
audience. Then share it and get feedback.

To me, sharing is the most exciting aspect of Structured Prompts. It lets
anyone take what you learned and apply it to their own context. For example,
[Microsoft has collected a set of our education
prompts](https://github.com/microsoft/prompts-for-edu/tree/main), which you
can freely build on or experiment with (we are not paid by Microsoft or any
other AI company). We hope other people will begin to share their Structured
Prompts as well.

## Where to start

The easiest way to get started with AI is to use it for tasks you do every
day. If you are writing an email, ask the AI to do it, and then use
conversational approaches to ask it to improve its performance. If you are
generating ideas, ask the AI. If you are trying to make a decision, give the
data to the AI and ask for an opinion. Don’t take any of this too seriously,
especially as you are first learning about its capabilities, but, after 10 or
so hours, you will start to really understand what AI can do.

Remember, it is very cheap for you to experiment with tasks you are already
doing every day, but it is much harder for other people to figure out how you
can best use AI. This has two implications. First, no one is going to be able
to help you too much, there is no instruction manual for your use case, you
will need to figure it out on your own. Second, you can become the world
expert in how to use AI to help you do your work, giving you a huge advantage.
When you are ready, you can start to share that advantage with others through
Structured Prompts. But even Structured Prompts seem like a temporary stage in
the development of AI, as AI gets more capable, it will increasingly prompt us
to help us accomplish our goals, rather than waiting for us to prompt it.

I heard a great tip the other day on how to get good prompts: "This is what I
want you to do, but I am not sure how to go about doing this, so you need to
ask me the questions to find out". I've tested it, and in many cases it works
really well!

Ethan, much gratitude for this. I led a session for almost a thousand people
in the Americas of a global company last week with the promise that the event
be about digital experience transformation and productivity. They are
fortunate to have a supportive leadership team and I was fortunate enough to
have had your experience to lean on. Your new prompt worksheet is amazing. I
will add pedagogy and personalization to my work going forward. I’m surprised
that I’m surprised that the key to me personally getting better results seems
to often fall back on me giving better, more authentic context. It’s like I’m
discovering more about my own mind by working with this alien mind as co-
pilot! All the best. You are making a huge difference.
